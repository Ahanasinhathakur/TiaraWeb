            <h3>About Us</h3>
            <p class="about-us-subtext">Tiara by Akshay Sharma is a Dubai-based family-run jewelry business established in the year 2013. 
                It was, however, in 1961, following Mr. Kamal Chand Jain’s passion for gemstones and jewelry that 
                the business found its footing in the world of high-quality gems, jewels, and a unique collection of 
                precious stones including diamonds, rubies, emeralds, sapphires, alexandrites, among other precious 
                stones, procured from all over the world.</p>
            <p class="about-us-tagline">“Our customers look for quality, which is the only thing that lasts”</p>
            <p class="about-us-sign w-100 mb-0">Akshay Sharma</p>
            <p class="about-us-person-desig w-100">Founder</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-6 mt-3">
            <p class="about-us-subtext">Mr. Kamal Chand Jain, grandfather of Akshay Sharma was invited to join a jewelry store owned by a few family friends as a salesman 
                in New Delhi, India. He would leave home at 7 AM and return only by 11 PM after a whole day’s hard work and toil. This is where 
                Kamal Chand Jain earned the reputation of a hardworking and honest man among his customers which included a Japanese buyer who, 
                upon learning that Mr. Jain was paid pocket money instead of a salary every month, offered to help him start his own business. 
                This step catapulted a small yet popular business where Mr. Kamal Chand Jain began selling precious gems and jewels to the Japanese 
                community living in New Delhi.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-6 mt-3">
            <p class="about-us-subtext">
                In due course, supported by his Japanese clients, the business grew to newer heights by 1968, when he opened a store near the diplomatic 
                area in New Delhi and acquired clients from USSR and other countries, gradually gaining trust for their clean business practices, impeccable quality, 
                and utmost customer excellence. Akshay Sharma’s father Mr. Vijay Kumar Jain joined the family business in 1978 at the age of 23, which took their 
                business to greater success as a result of the promising partnership between the father-son duo.

            you can make a long-time legacy." - Vijay Kumar Jain</p>

            <p class="showroom-subtext">As a young boy of 4, Akshay Sharma was exposed to several precious stones around him which taught him how to understand gems and their 
                different kinds, along with learning negotiation skills from his father and being able to grasp what the customer was looking for, and in turn, offer them exactly that. 
                AV joined his father in the business during his college days, which he would manage along with academics. The shift of the business from Delhi to Dubai and Hong Kong 
                subsequently helped them connect with a large number of clientele from varied backgrounds. Choosing Dubai as their base was a well-thought-out choice as doing business 
                from Dubai proved to be faster, feasible, and more comfortable. Today, Akshay Sharma is the proud owner of the world’s most expensive fancy purplish-red diamond, as well as 
                green, blue, and pink diamonds; a large collection of alexandrites, which are often referred to as “emerald by day, ruby by night” by many gem aficionados, and more.</p>
