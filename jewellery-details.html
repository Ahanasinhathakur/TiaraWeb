            <p class="product-details">The most classic and traditional choice for centuries, colourless diamonds have 
                certainly ruled in terms of popularity among the rich and the famous of the world. Until the 16th century, 
                the most celebrated diamonds – both colourless and the coloured ones – all came from India. Now, they are 
                found in various parts of the world. Some of the largest diamond manufacturing regions for white diamonds 
                include South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Zimbabwe, Angola, Democratic Republic of Congo, Canada and Russia.</p>

            <p class="mt-4 product-details">The term “colourless” for white diamonds means lack of colour. White diamonds 
                possess very subtle hints of yellow or brown, which affect the value of the stone. The colour of a diamond 
                is measured on an alphabetical scale starting from D, meaning “colourless”. A pure and structurally perfect 
                white diamond has no colour, making it higher in value than a diamond with hints of yellow or brown. White 
                diamonds can be found relatively easily in comparison, to fancy colour diamonds. The Cullinan diamond 
                (the largest gem quality diamond ever found), the Excelsior and The Taylor-Burton (named after the late 
                Hollywood legends) are just a few of the world’s most famous colourless diamonds. Timeless appeal and 
                tradition are the biggest benefits of these dazzling clear gems, along with being more affordable than 
                fancy colour diamonds like pink, blue, green or red diamonds.</p>

            <h4 class="product-name">Red Diamond</h4>
            <p class="product-details">The rarest diamond on earth is the red diamond. It is so rare that even if the red colour is the modifier, 
                or the secondary colour, the price of the diamond shoots up. No other colour has such a dramatic effect as 
                a modifier. The rarity of a diamond also plays a big part in determining its value, and coloured diamonds 
                as whole beat the colourless ones in this respect. The red and pink colours, for instance, in a diamond 
                are caused by plastic deformation of the crystal lattice owing to temperature and pressure. Of all 
                coloured diamonds, red diamonds are the rarest. A red diamond that recently made jewellery auction sale 
                history is a rare 1.05-carat red diamond ring of sold in Geneva for $2.77 million, establishing a 
                Christie’s and world record of price per carat for a diamond of that color. The 1.05-carat fancy 
                purplish-red diamond with VS2 clarity was bought by Tiara by Akshay Sharma. The most well-known historical and 
                current sources of natural fancy colour diamonds are India, South Africa, Australia, Brazil, Venezuela, South 
                America, Russia, and Indonesia. South Africa is famed for its red, pink, blue, orange and yellow natural fancy diamonds.</p>

            <h4 class="product-name">Pink Diamond</h4>
            <p class="product-details">Coloured diamonds hide inclusions better. While a white diamond with inclusions loses value, 
                a coloured one will not. Since the colour is permanent, the inclusions can remain hidden through the entire life of the diamond.  Coloured diamonds 
                are more valuable and expensive compared to white diamonds, making them a better choice for investments. Pink diamonds are currently 1,150 times as 
                expensive as the finest white diamond, which is internally flawless and has the highest colour rating. Pink diamonds, which are sourced mostly from Australia. 
                Historically they have also been found in India, South Africa, Canada, Russia and Brazil. This has increased both their rarity and their price. The Pink Star, a 
                diamond weighing 59.60 carat, was sold at a 2017 auction in Hong Kong for $71.2 million to Chow Tai Fook Enterprises. A factor that affects the value of fancy colour 
                diamonds is fashion trends. For example, pink diamonds fetched higher prices after Hollywood actor Jennifer Lopez received a pink diamond engagement ring</p>

        <div class="col-sm-12 mt-4">
            <h4 class="product-name">Blue Diamond</h4>
            <p class="product-details">Fancy colour diamonds like pink, purple, green and blue diamonds come under the high price range category, while red 
                ones are classed as “ultra-high as far as prices are concerned. Two of the most famous diamonds in the world are coloured 
                diamonds - the Yellow Tiffany Diamond and the brilliant blue Hope Diamond. Other famous coloured diamonds include the blue Heart 
                of Eternity and the Golden Jubilee. Fancy color diamonds such as the deep blue Hope Diamond are among the most valuable and sought after 
                diamonds in the world. In 2009, a 7-carat blue diamond fetched the then highest price per carat ever paid for a diamond when it was 
                sold at auction for 10.5 million Swiss francs ($9.5 million) which is in excess of $1.3 million per carat.  This record was again broken 
                in 2016 when the Oppenheimer Blue, a 14.62-carat vivid blue diamond became the most expensive jewel ever sold at an auction. It is the largest 
                fancy vivid blue diamond classified ever sold at auction, and sold at Christie’s in Geneva in 2016 for $50.6 million. </p>

            <h4 class="product-name">Green Diamond</h4>
            <p class="product-details">The color of a green diamond originates from the exposure to the atomic radiation that the has 
                stone endured over millions of years. Even though the green colour is a result of exposure to radioactivity, 
                holding the stone is completely safe. The formation process, however, is incredibly rare, resulting in a colored diamond that is extremely 
                difficult to obtain. Among fancy colour diamonds, natural colour green stones are some of the rarest and most sought after. Most of the world’s 
                current production of fine natural green diamonds comes from South America or Africa. Laboratory irradiation treatments have been used commercially 
                since the late 1940s to create the green color in diamond and closely mimic the effects of natural radiation exposure.  Green diamonds range from a 
                light green to a rich, deep hue. They are graded on the following scale: Faint Green, Very Light Green, Light Green, Fancy Light Green, Fancy Green, 
                Fancy Intense, Fancy Vivid and Fancy Deep. The Dresden Green Diamond is a 41-carat natural green diamond said to have originated in India’s Andhra Pradesh state. 
                It is a rare green diamond, with a clarity of VS1 and is said to be potentially internally flawless, if slightly recut. Named after the city of Dresden in Germany, 
                where it has been on display for most of the last two centuries, the Dresden Green Diamond has a historical record dating back to 1722. It was acquired by Augustus III of 
                Poland from a Dutch merchant in 1742. In 1768, the diamond was incorporated into its current setting of a highly valuable hat ornament, surrounded by two large and 411 
                medium-sized and small diamonds. </p>

            <h4 class="product-name">Yellow Diamond</h4>
            <p class="product-details">Yellow diamonds currently possess the highest market demand of all other colored diamonds in 
                the market. One of the most significant trend changing factors is of famous celebrities flaunting their 
                Yellow Diamond jewellery, thus, rapidly increasing their popularity. For instance, after Hollywood 
                celebrity Paris Hilton got engaged with a large canary yellow diamond engagement ring, the demand for coloured diamonds increased 
                dramatically. Though coloured diamonds can be quite expensive due to their rarity, yellow diamonds can be quite affordable, and 
                sometimes cost less than a colorless diamond of the same quality. Moreover, being extremely rare with unique characteristics have 
                made yellow diamonds highly sought after. Like other natural fancy coloured diamonds, the colours are a result of the compound 
                element within the structure of the stone. The stones with a stronger yellow hue are often the result of more Nitrogen in the mix.   
                Owing to their varying hues, yellow diamonds have come to be known by  a number of nicknames. Many refer to yellow diamonds as Canary, 
                as in a Canary Yellow Diamond, while some use the name Zimmy. A Canary yellow diamond actually refers to only a yellow stone with a very rich, high intensity yellow or 
                fancy vivid yellow. The term Zimmy, used often when referring to a vivid yellow with a deeper hue, actually refers to extraordinary vivid yellow diamonds which 
                originated from the Zimmy mine located in Sierra Leone. Yellow diamonds, among all other coloured ones, are found less than one 
                thousandth of the time compared to a white stone. That is, only 0.0001percent of mined diamonds are of 
                fancy colours. Yellow diamonds happen to be among the more commonly found colour in this category. The 
                countries known best for producing these are Australia, Angola, Borneo, Brazil, Congo, and Sierra Leone.</p>
